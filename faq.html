        <h3 id="faq-0">What is GitHub Enterprise?</h3>
          <p>GitHub Enterprise is the on-premise version of <a href="https://github.com/home">GitHub.com</a>.
          It makes collaborative coding possible and enjoyable for large-scale enterprise software development teams.
          A full list of specs and features are detailed on our
          <a href="http://github-public.s3.amazonaws.com/enterprise.github.com/datasheet.pdf">data sheet</a>.</p>

        <h3 id="faq-1">How is GitHub Enterprise different from <a href="http://github.com">GitHub.com</a>?</h3>
          <p>GitHub Enterprise includes the same great set of features
          as <a href="https://github.com/home">GitHub.com</a> but packaged for
          running on your organization's local network. All repository data is
          stored on machines that you control, and access is integrated with your
          organization's authentication system (LDAP, CAS). Use GitHub Enterprise
          when you need complete control over repository and project information.</p>

        <h3 id="faq-2">Can I evaluate GitHub Enterprise within my organization before purchasing?</h3>
          <p>Yes. <strong>45-day</strong> evaluation licenses are available and may be
          upgraded to full licenses at any time during the trial period. To get started,
          <a href="/trial">submit a trial license request</a>. We'll contact you shortly
          after with information on downloading the software and installing trial
          license keys.</p>

        <h3 id="faq-3">What hardware and software are required?</h3>
          <p>GitHub Enterprise ships as a virtual machine image that includes all
          software required to get up and running. The only additional software
          required is a compatible virtual machine environment.</p>
          <p>The following minimal hardware requirements are suggested for production
          deployments:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Processor:</strong>
              Two 3.0 GHz CPU cores <em>(or virtual equivalent)</em>
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Memory:</strong>
              8 GB
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Disk:</strong>
              75 GB VM root partition
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Storage:</strong>
              High-performance SAN or locally attached storage
            </li>
          </ul>

        <h3 id="faq-4">Which Virtual Machine environments are supported?</h3>
          <p>The software is currently distributed in the industry standard
          <em>Open Virtualization Format</em>
          (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_Virtualization_Format">OVF</a>)
          only. Environments with official OVF support include:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li><a href="http://www.vmware.com/">VMware</a></li>
            <li><a href="https://www.virtualbox.org/">VirtualBox</a></li>
          </ul>
          <p>Please <a href="/contact">contact us</a> if your environment is not
          listed above.</p>

        <h3 id="faq-5">Can I use my organization's LDAP directory to manage user access?</h3>
          <p>Yes. GitHub Enterprise supports user authentication via external
          <strong>LDAP</strong> or <strong>CAS</strong> services. The setup process
          includes a step for configuring your organization's LDAP/CAS server
          information.</p>
          <p>By default, GitHub Enterprise runs in a self-contained authentication
          mode with user information stored in the GitHub Enterprise database. LDAP
          or CAS is not required.</p>

        <h3 id="faq-6">How do I control access to Git repositories?</h3>

          <p>The product includes a number of features that provide complete control over
          repository access. Each repository may specify the following general
          access rights for any user:</p>

          <ul>
            <li><strong>Admin</strong>: Full access to the repository, including the
            ability to control access for other users.</li>

            <li><strong>Read + Write</strong>: Users may push changes into the repository
            and pull changes from the repository.</li>

            <li><strong>Read-only</strong>: Users may browse the repository via the web
            interface and use git to fetch changes but may not push into the repository.</li>
          </ul>

          <p>In addition, GitHub Enterprise ships with the same
          <a href="https://github.com/features/projects/collaboration">collaboration
          features for Organizations</a> found on github.com. These simplify the process
          of managing access for teams of users that you define.</p>

        <h3 id="faq-7">Can I use GitHub Enterprise to host projects on the public internet?</h3>
          <p>No. GitHub Enterprise is designed for collaboration within an organization
          only. Externally accessible installations must have the <strong>Private Mode</strong>
          option enabled. Note that <a href="https://github.com">github.com</a> offers free
          hosting of unlimited public repositories.
          </p>

        <h3 id="faq-8">How is GitHub Enterprise different from GitHub Firewall Install?</h3>
          <p>GitHub Enterprise is the latest release of our on-premise
          product with a re-engineered back end and our new customer
          dashboard. GitHub Firewall Install differed from it primarily
          by being installed and run on a server that required manual
          configuration. GitHub Enterprise is distributed as a Virtual
          Appliance that runs as a virtual machine under your company's
          existing virtualization infrastructure. This makes getting
          started with and maintaining GitHub Enterprise much easier.</p>
          <p>Enterprise also incorporates many of the newer improvements
          made in GitHub.com that were not available in GitHub Firewall Install.
          Some of the highlights include:
          </p>

            <li>Massive improvements in speed and stability</li>
          </ul>
          <p>If you are a current FI customer and are interested to
          learn about the zero-cost migration over to GitHub Enterprise,
          please contact <a href="mailto:sales@github.com">sales@github.com</a>.
          </p>

        <h3 id="faq-9">What is a Virtual Appliance?</h3>
          <p>You can think of a virtual appliance as the equivalent of a
          network appliance that you might buy, mount in a rack, and plug
          into your network. The only difference is that it runs as a
          virtual machine inside of VMware or some other virtualization
          platform rather than as a physical device you mount in a rack.</p>
          <p>This saves time (you can download the appliance and all updates
          immediately) and space (you just add it to your existing
          virtualization infrastructure). It also makes managing, backing up,
          and restoring the appliance easy because you can use your
          virtualization platform's built-in snapshotting capabilities.
          </p>
          <p>You can learn more about virtual appliances <a href="http://www.vmware.com/appliances/getting-started/learn/overview.html">here</a>.</p>

        <h3 id="faq-10">Do you offer training?</h3>
          <p>Yes. We offer web-based training, in-person training and provide
          a myriad of free, high-quality educational materials. Please contact the
          <a href="http://training.github.com/" class="ga-training-faq">GitHub Training Team</a>
