              <p>it could be done, but I didn't take "wasn't optimistic it could be done" for an answer. Could it be love? I know what an erection feels like, Michael. No, it's the opposite. It's like my heart is getting hard. Here he comes. Here comes John Wayne. A lady of the evening. Working girl. She turns illusions for money. "Circumvent." It means "to go around." Gob: The old "reach around." She's not 'that Mexican', Mom. She's my Mexican. And she's Colombian or something. Well, OK, have sex with this girl. Right now. Get in there, have some sex with her.</p>

              <p>the actor. Lucille: They said he was some kind of scientist. Hey, it was one night of wild passion! And yet you didn't notice her body? I like to look in the mirror. No borders, no limits... go ahead, touch the Cornballer... you know best? Sweet old thing. Only two of those words describe Mom, so I know you're lying to me. You can control your bladder when you're dead!</p>
